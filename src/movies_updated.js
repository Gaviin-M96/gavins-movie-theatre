Taking us back to where it all began, Straight Outta Compton tells the true story of how these cultural rebels—armed only with their lyrics, swagger, bravado and raw talent—stood up to the authorities that meant to keep them down and formed the world’s most dangerous group, N.W.A.  And as they spoke the truth that no one had before and exposed life in the hood, their voice ignited a social revolution that is still reverberating today.",

The Driver delivers the money, writing the sum on his hand as instructed by the hostage taker. After he is told that he holds the life of a person in his hand, he is ordered to burn the money. As he complies, the federal agents break in and attempt to subdue the man, who shoots himself in the head before he reveals where the woman is hidden. The Driver then tries to find the hostage before she drowns in the trunk of a sinking car. As a twist, the kidnapped woman is revealed to be the hostage taker's lover. She coldly taunts the dying man in the hospital."

I Feel Like a Woman!\" finds a stunning Twain fronting a band of mindless hunks in a funny reversal of Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love\" video. \"You're Still the One,\" easily one of Twain's most affecting songs, still holds up as a softly erotic short film. Even Twain's more prosaic videos (the go-kart mania of \"You Win My Love\") bear repeat viewing, but it's her heck-with-it aesthetic that leads to such unexpected sights as Irish step dancing in \"Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You).\" Then, of course, there are those hot pants in \"Rock This Country!\" Long may Shania wave.",
